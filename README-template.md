## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 


Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.


**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="image">
  <img src="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div class="text">
  <p class="head">PERFUME</p>

  <h1>Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>

  <p>A floral, solar and voluptuous <br>
  interpretation composed by <br>
  Olivier Polge, Perfumer-Creator <br>
  for the House of CHANEL
  </p>

  <div class="price">
    <p class="price1">$149.99</p>
    <p class="price2">$169.99</p>
  </div>

  <button><img src="./images/icons8-cart-32.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> Add to Cart</button>
</div>

I'm quite proud of this part of my code mainly because i was having quite an issue with the <img> tag, i was debating between using <picture> tag but it wasn't working but this was the closest thing to what i wanted.
```

```css
@media screen and (max-width:375px) {
  body {
    width: 375px
  }

  .container {
    height: 900px;
    width: 300px;
    display: block;
    margin: 40px;
  }

  button { display: block;
   justify-content: center;
    width: 95%;
  }

  button img {
    margin-bottom: -10px;
  }
}

I'm not really proficient in media queries and all I know about it is from the internet but from my little knowledge I was able to accomplish this.ðŸ˜Š
